# (Furano Avalanche Center)[https://furanoavalanche.org]

Furano is a town in the center of Hokkaido, the northernmost prefecture of Japan. It is situated next to Daisetsuzan, the largest national park in Japan, and sandwiched between two mountain ranges that see epic quantities of some of the best snow on earth. 

🏔 It is where I live 😎.

We have access to fantastic snow and amazing terrain, but there is no official government-sponsored avalanche forecast for this region. This site is a pro-bono effort to give a platform for one of our local ski guides to post avalanche safety observations.

The site is built with Hugo and Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS), extended with some custom content types.

It features graphics from avalanche.org with permission.
