    Ryan Taylor first guided Furano in 2011, long before it was on the radar.
    This was a time when the most obvious, lift accessed areas would go
    untouched throughout the season. Having skied for 20 years and studying
    Japanese since a young age, Ryan was quick to fall in love with Furano. This
    area is becoming more popular which makes having a knowledgeable guide
    increasingly valuable.

    Ryan grew up in New Zealand's rugged Southern Alps. Since 2014, he has been
    prolific in achieving countless human-powered 1st ski descents deep in the
    backcountry. You can read about some of his adventures on his personal blog.

    Ryan is a driven, semi-pro ski mountaineer supported by Earth Sea Sky,
    Fischer Skis and Fritschi Swiss Bindings. He is famous for hiking days in
    search of 1st ski descents in spectacular settings. - On a clear day in
    Furano, many large mountain faces are visible, Ryan has skied all of these
    and has progressed to pursuing lines in increasingly obscure places. Steep
    skiing aside, he loves exploring new areas and skiing the moderate powder
    that Hokkaido is famous for.

    Ryan enjoys the rewarding process of sharing experiences with others through
    guiding and aims to inspire you to spend more time outside, appreciating
    nature and the amazing experiences it offers.

  <p>
    In the past, Ryan has gained a lot running backcountry tours for 2 of the
    major guiding operations. He is now excited to have the freedom to share
    Hokkaido in the way he sees best. This also allows him to guide in new areas
    without having to share his secrets with a larger operation.

    With a background in Geology and Cartography, Ryan is constantly studying
    maps and the lay of the land to find the best powder stashes for your soul.
    He uses the latest software to build his own private maps. He is an expert
    in route finding and planning trips to unexplored areas.

    In recent years, Ryan has made expeditions to Greenland and Tajikistan
    twice. In May, 2019, his self-planned expedition to Tajikistan (supported by
    the Mt Everest Foundation, New Zealand Alpine Club and Black Diamond) was a
    huge success where multiple, unique lines up to 5300m were skied.

  <p>Ryan looks forward to showing you his backyard.</p>
