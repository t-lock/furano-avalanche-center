  <h3>Furano Avalanche Center (FAC)</h3>
  <p>
    FAC is an avalanche blog run by local Furano backcountry guides who saw the
    need to provide current avalanche condition information to the public. There
    is a lack of a comprehensive government forecasts in most places in Japan
    (central Hokkaido included) in comparison to what is available in most
    developed countries.
  </p>
  <p>
    The primary aim of FAC is to help readers understand the importance of
    avalanche education and to reduce the accident rate. There have already been
    several instances where the contributors of this blog posted observations
    and warned of dangerous conditions <strong>before</strong> accidents
    occurred.
  </p>
  <p>
    The primary intended audience are local (central Hokkaido) backcountry
    users. It is our understanding that avalanche safety knowledge and education
    are lacking among backcountry users in our region, relative to other popular
    winter mountain hubs around the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    Snowpack character varies greatly between regions, making local knowledge
    indispensible. In Hokkaido, avalanche conditions often extend down to sea
    level.
  </p>
  <p>
    FAC began operating in 2019. Since then, overwhelming feedback from the
    local community has been very encouraging. As a result, the blog continues
    to grow in quality of information shared and size of audience.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since 2022, the blog has also been produced on this website to reach a wider
    audience. Like the guides who contribute observations, this website was
    developed and is maintained by local Furano volunteers.
  </p>

  <h3>People</h3>
  <p>
    Ryan Taylor of
    <a href="https://www.furanoadventuretours.com/" target="_blank"
      >Furano Adventure Tours</a
    >
    led the initiative to create FAC in 2019. To this day he is the most
    frequent contributor although often much of the information he shares is
    provided by other local guides who wish to remain anonymous.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ryan has been guiding and exploring Furano area since 2010, has accomplished
    1st known ski descents in the area, and has a deep understanding of the
    conditions from the lowland forest to the highest remote peaks. He has made
    1st ski descents in countries such as NZ, Greenland, Tajikistan and Japan.
  </p>
  <p>
    His education includes professional avalanche qualifications recognized in
    the West (qualifications held by foreign forecasters in Japan are not
    recognized at a high level by the Japanese government), and BSc in Earth
    Science and a Post Graduate Diploma in GIS with focus on avalanche and
    terrain modeling. He spends his summers mostly working as an exploration
    geologist in the remote mountains of Hokkaido.

  <h3>Third Parties</h3>
  <p>
    While we strongly encourage avalanche education,
    <strong>we do not accept advertisements</strong> on our blog. If you run
    avalanche courses in the area, we are happy to include your observations,
    with attribution, on the blog if we feel they complement the existing
    content.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you come from a background of avalanche forecasting and have lived in
    Furano for several years, you could likely become a contributor. We are
    particularly interested in finding a native Japanese speaking contributor.
    See <a href="/contributing">contributing</a> for more.
  </p>
  <p>
    The idea to create a resource like this has long been talked about by many
    parties, but never happened prior to the launch of FAC in 2019, at least in
    part due to clashes in business interests. It is our belief that while a
    single company can provide a good set of observations, a combination of
    guides from different backgrounds operating in different ways, communicating
    openly, will provide the best information for local backcountry users.
    Furano Avalanche Center is where guides from different local companies come
    together to contribute to the greater good.
