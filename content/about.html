    FAC (Furano Avalanche Center) is an avalanche blog run by local Furano
    guides who saw the need to provide avalanche condition information to the
    public. There is a lack of a comprehensive government forecasts in most
    places in Japan in comparison to what is available in most developed
    countries.
  </p>
  <p>
    The primary aim is to help readers understand the importance of avalanche
    education and to reduce the accident rate. There have already been several
    instances where the contributors of this blog posted observations and warned
    of dangerous conditions before accidents occurred. Furano Avalanche Center
    is where guides from different local companies come together to contribute
    to the greater good.

    The idea to create a resource like this has long been talked about by many
    people but never happened likely due to clashes in business interests. While
    a single company can provide a good set of observations, a combination of
    guides from different backgrounds operating in different ways, communicating
    openly, leads to the industry leading avalanche blog provided here.
  </p>
  <p>
    The primary intended audience are local backcountry users as it is our
    understanding that the amount of people educated around avalanche safety is
    lacking relative to other backcountry recreation hubs around the world. In
    Hokkaido, avalanche conditions often extend down to sea level.
  </p>
  <p>
    The overwhelming feedback from the local community has been very encouraging
    so as a result, this blog continues to grow in quality of information shared
    and size of audience.

    Ryan Taylor of

    was the 1st person to lead the initiative to create FAC in 2019. To this day
    he is the most frequent contributor although often much of the information
    he shares is provided by other local guides who wish to remain anonymous.
    From 2022, the blog was also produced on this website to reach a wider
    audience.

    Ryan has been guiding and exploring Furano area since 2010, has accomplished
    1st know ski descents in the area and has a deep understanding of the
    conditions from the lowland forest to the highest remote peaks. Many would
    say he is the most knowledgeable guide in the area in terms of the terrain.
    He made 1st ski descents in countries such as NZ, Greenland, Tajikistan and
    Japan.

  <p>
    His education includes professional avalanche qualifications recognized in
    the west (Qualifications held by foreign forecasters in Japan are not
    recognized at a high level by the Japanese government), and Bsc in Earth
    Science and a Post Graduate Diploma in GIS with focus on avalanche and
    terrain modeling. He spends his summers mostly working as an exploration
    geologist in the remote mountains of Hokkaido.

    While we strongly encourage avalanche education, we do not accept
    advertisements on our blog. If you run avalanche courses in the area, we are
    happy to provide your resulting observations on the page if we feel it
    complements the existing content. If you come from a background of avalanche
    forecasting and have lived in Furano for several years, you could likely
    become a contributor. We are particularly interested in finding a native
    Japanese speaking contributor.
