  日本語の記事がなくてすみません。 私は今、スキーシーズン直前で準備がとても忙しいです。

  T﻿he 20230114 crust layer is generally buried about 20cm down now with snow
  that fell last night (20230121) and several other small dustings that occurred
  over the last week. Little snow has fallen in Furano since the warm weather
  event.


  M﻿ost weather forecasts are now showing a lot of snow over the next week
  with the usual W or NW winds. This set up usually comes with the risk of wind
  slab and storm slab around the more intense parts of the storm.


  Temperatures are cold and wind speed forecast to be relatively low so skiing
  conditions should be very good. Watch out for new glide cracks and ice
  monsters around trees that emerged during the warm weather when the FL went
  above 1000m in most parts of Hokkaido.


  Recently, I was skiing NW of Furano where the was a lot more snow, 60cm on
  the 20230114 crust layer. On a wind loaded 40 degree slope at 700m, I got a
  result of CTH21SP on a 60cm wide column. - So after quite a lot of force was
  applied it seemed possible to trigger a 60cm wind slab, perhaps low
  probability of triggering it but high consequence so we were very careful on
  that day. This layer is already quite stable in many other parts of Hokkaido.
  It seems to be more dangerous on steeper faces at mid and low elevations that
  also got sun crusted (i.e. this is often the steep SE or E facing slopes.)


  I﻿ will not be in Furano for the next several days."
