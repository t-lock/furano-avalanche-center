  To continue the story from the previous post. The period of speculated good
  stability and good skiing conditions has come to a close. The last few days
  were very cold but also sunny. Some suncrust developed on steep solar aspects
  with some hoar frost in some shaded aspects. Conditions vary around central
  Hokkaido.


  Currently, we have an abnormal storm coming into central Hokkaido from the SW, Central, SE and W Hokkaido are in the process of being hit.


  Because the wind is coming form the SW vs the common NW, look out for wind loading in different places vs normal. i.e. NE aspects. 


  Different forecasts are showing different wind directions.


  We expect this new layer that is forming this evening (20260107 layer) to be reactive in places over the next few days. Probable storm slab risk on all aspects during and immediately after the storm in our opinion.


  A﻿lso be wary when the freezing level rises above 0 in coming days.


  As usual, watch the risk of loose snow avalanche near terrain traps and steep sided creeks... and enjoy Hokkaido safely,
