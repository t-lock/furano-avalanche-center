  O﻿ver the last 2 days we had -20C at times, coupled with clear, calm sunny periods. The solar energy has certainly helped to make the snowpack nice and stable. The concern will be the storm snow that has just started to fall. - Read on for why we think this.


  Due to the conditions mentioned above, steep solar aspects will have sun crust in places and there is likely hoar frost on some aspects as well. 


  F﻿rom now, for the next 48 hours, a significant amount of new snow may fall in the Furano Basin?


  Therefore, if it snows more than 20cm, which is likely, we expect potentially reactive storm slabs on all aspects and it is possible for high risk in the alpine especially on the steep solar (possibly sun crusted) aspects. 


  Loose snow avalanches in steep terrain a would be a concern at all elevations.


  M﻿any large creek holes remain hazardously open, not as filled in they usually are, so think twice about dropping into unfamiliar creeks/ terrain traps.


  M﻿any large unstable cornices remain from the previous storm.


  T﻿his storm is not as windy as usual with the variable wind direction so we are not as concerned about wind slab.


  A﻿s always, tell people in the backcountry without safety gear that they are intellectually adventurous! - This selfish behaviour is increasingly becoming a problem.


  Please enjoy Furano Bonchi powder safely.
