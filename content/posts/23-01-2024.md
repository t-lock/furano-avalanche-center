  雪崩心配している。


  日本語の記事がなくてすみません。\r

  私は今、スキーシーズン直前で準備がとても忙しいです。\r

  O﻿ver the last week it has not snowed very much in the Furano Basin and
  stability was good. Since the last significant snow fall(20240115), there have
  been many sunny days, resulting in a firm temperature crust or simply denser
  than usual snow. Additionally, steep S-E aspects are quite suncrusted.\ 


  I﻿ ski cut/ triggered a size 2- wind slab on the S aspect of a steep sided
  gully on 20240117, but since then I have only experienced stable snow. On this
  same day, I was also surprised how many open creek holes were in the valley I
  visited. Glide cracks are also larger and more open than normal so, as usual,
  I will try not to crash into them or spend unnecessary amounts of time below
  them.\ 


  Y﻿esterday, a storm blowing from the SE began to hit Hokkaido, resulting in
  more snowfall SE of Furano. It has snowed a little in Furano too with moderate
  - strong winds. It is difficult to tell exactly how much has snowed from my
  base here in the center of the Furano Basin as the winds have stripped all the
  new snow on the flat open farm fields around me yet filled in all my shin deep
  foot prints I made a few days ago.\ 


  I﻿ will refer to this new layer as the 20240122 layer and I would not be
  surprised if it is unstable. Mostly, I am concerned about Loading on N - W
  aspects in areas that are usually wind stripped. - As most storms are coming
  from the complete opposite direction, this may take many by surprise. For
  example, Tokachidake is usually stable being mostly windward facing terrain,
  but now there is loading on suncrusts. (I saw many brilliant sunsets on the
  west aspects of Daisetsuzan over the past week, hence assuming suncrusts)\ 


  Currently, there may be dangerous wind slabs on these loaded N - W aspects
  where/ if significant snow has accumulated.


  Tomorrow afternoon, the 24th, the wind direction is forecast to switch to
  NW.


  Significant snow is also forecast through the 25th with strong winds. - I
  anticipate this will almost certainly lead to unstable & dangerous wind slabs
  on SE aspects and possibly unstable storm slabs on all aspects.


  M﻿aybe my assumption of 'High' overall risk level in the banner of this blog
  post is conservative, but I won't know until the 2nd half of this storm falls
  and get a chance to ski it. Likely I wont have time to update in the near
  future either. I won't be surprised to hear about big avalanches in Central
  Hokkaido.


  I﻿f the longer range forecasts are correct and it doesn't snow after the
  27th for a few days then stability should steadily improve from then.



  H﻿ave fun, be safe & enjoy Furano!"
