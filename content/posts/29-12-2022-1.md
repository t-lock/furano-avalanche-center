  日本語の記事がなくてすみません。


  私は今、スキーシーズン直前で準備がとても忙しいです。


  DeepLという翻訳サイトがとてもクオリティが良いので、使ってみて下さい: [https://www.deepl.com/translator](https://www.deepl.com/translator?fbclid=IwAR3Ern1iJ5xLbYLl8dmr5a7xm1T3Aiil5X5AF74PnBnAUAnxdh5J_2VfdHQ)


  L﻿ast night a new storm cycle began. Weather forecasts suggest that it will be snowing most of the time until tomorrow evening (20221230). 


  A﻿valanche risk currently and over the next few days will likely be ithis new 20221228 layer. i.e.  between the old, dense snow and the current new snow.


  T﻿his new snow falling is forecast to be cold and dry. I think it may not bond well initially and there will certainly be a risk of loose dry avalanches running easily on the old dense snow (20221228) in steep terrain. This will become a bigger issue as the snow continues to accumulate.


  T﻿here will likely be a risk of storm slab on all aspects and elevations, with most risk on the mid and higher elevation E and SE slopes due to forecast W and NW winds during the storm.


  T﻿he 31st will be a beautiful day, but I will be sure to check the stability of new snow on the old snow (20221228 layer) before skiing any steep, complex avalanche terrain.
