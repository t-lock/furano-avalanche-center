  Tomamu area observations by Murray of Alpine Backcountry Guides:


  (﻿scroll down to see other observations below)


  "There has been a lot of snow here, I think at least half a meter if not more, I probed an average of 185cm in Karakachi pass on an east slope prior to the winds coming from the west. It was super light but in the past day or two, there have been big winds, changing directions from mainly easterly to mainly westerly and n, e and s aspects seem to be pretty wind packed today (20240206), heavy snow very hard to break trail through and rather difficult to ski. There has been plenty of large whumphing over the last few days since new snow fall on what I am assuming is the buried hoar layer as it only seems to be on shady aspects. Today at 983m due east 30degree slope in the tomamu backcountry I did 2 CT's and had a ct11 and ct12, both sudden planar fractures on what looked liked df 30cm down (I didn't loupe it). The pack is very right side up with roughly the top 50 being between 1f and 4f. I did not have any shooting cracks whilst skinning or skiing but did jump on the snow between switchbacks and was having propagating slabs release between the skin tracks rather easily." 




  O﻿ther observations from an anonymous source:


  "﻿Today (20240207) there was a large avalanche on a big mountain near Tomamu on a NE aspect resulting in a 1m high crown wall." 




  R﻿yan from FAT:


  "﻿No avalanche activity observed in the Furano backcountry after skiing steep terrain the last 2 days on a variety of aspects in the mid elevations as higher is wind effected by yesterday's strong westerly. Today (202502027), Even on north aspects, snow feels a little heavy and is not sluffing much. Looking forward to the next snowfall."
