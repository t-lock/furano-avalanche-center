  Since the previous﻿ post, there were 2 more pluses of snow with similar wind direction, NW.


  Quickly after the previous blog post the stability improved a lot. - Slightly increasing temperatures probably helped.


  I was skiing untracked snow, season deep, non skier compacted snow in the Yubari Mountains on various aspects up to 1000m today and stability was very good on the slopes I skied.


  However, I have not yet been to the high Alpine so there is a chance there are some overloaded slopes that are not yet stable. A logical assumption would be that the SE slopes in the high alpine maybe be unstable due to additional wind loading.


  C﻿rossing over various aspects, it is obvious that the SE and E aspects have a lot more snow than the NW and W aspects. I found best skiing conditions on cross loaded NE slopes.


  T﻿here is increasingly less snow in the forecast so stability should improve into the coming weather window which may be a good opportunity to ski alpine avalanche terrain assuming stability keeps improving at this rate.


  A﻿fter a few more storm sets the creeks of the Yubari Mountains will mostly be filled in and backcountry skiing will be on in central Hokkaido. Until then, there are still a few dangerous twigs and log traps lurking beneath the surface.
