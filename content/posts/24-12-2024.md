  E﻿arly and mid December made for a good start to the season with consistent snowfalls. 


  A﻿valanche risk is currently relatively low but it will certainly increase from the evening of the 25th Dec.


  S﻿ince before the winter solstice, around 20th Dec, there has been little to no snowfall in the Furano Valley or around the ski area. The past several days have been cold and still, with frosts every morning here at my base in the heart of the Furano Valley, Nakafurano (192m).


  W﻿hile Furano may receive a dusting for Xmas Eve, there won't be significant snowfall until the evening of the 25th, increasing through the 26th where it appears we will once again be entering a period of more consistent snowfall with moderate westerly winds.


  There is now hoarfrost on the snow surface which could lead to the formation of a dangerous, unstable layer on all aspects, especially the to be loaded NE to SE aspects. This will likely mostly be at mid and higher elevations where there are open clearings and steep sided gullies that are still hard to access with early season conditions. I still have not been higher than 1300m elevation in the Furano Mountains this season.


  U﻿ntil now, I have not been concerned about avalanches as most slopes are still below the threshold for avalanches with many protruding bushes, branches and open/ partially covered creek holes being the biggest hazards. Remember a warm jacket is just as import as your avalanche gear if you are injured, lost or stuck in the backcountry.


  Around Furano Ski Area, I﻿ have seen many inexperienced backcountry skiers/ riders following tracks and ending up in difficult situations, faced with bushy and treacherous exits that are not yet properly filled in. Please know what you are getting yourself into and follow the rules and guidelines of patrol. - Read the signs on the backcountry gates and realize some of them do not go back to the ski area.


  In recent days, many large glide cracks have opened up and there has been a few large glide crack avalanches. It is not a good idea to spend time below these cracked slopes. While the snow itself is relatively stable, it can slide off the bamboo grass underneath. When skiing over blind rollers, or coming out of the trees and into a clearing, make sure there isn't a large crack in front of you even if there was no crack there a few days ago as they can suddenly appear. It is hard to know when these will release, but if it looks sketchy, it probably is!


  It seems it will be the most backcountry skiers here on record so please look out for each other, have a fun and safe season! よろしくお願いします。
