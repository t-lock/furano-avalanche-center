  S﻿orry for the significant delay in sharing posts and observations, my life
  got a little crazy. Going forward, I will be spending more time in the
  mountains so expect more activity on this blog.


  A﻿s it is now mid-February, the intensity of the sun is increasing. Sun and temperature crust layers, especially on steep S-E aspects will become more pronounced. 


  Generally, t﻿his means that after and during storms it will become easier to trigger slabs around steep faces, especially when loaded by the prevailing NW winds, and that any potential avalanches can run further and gain momentum on the firmer crust layers. 


  I﻿t has snowed a lot in the last week or 2 with the high mountains of Central Hokkaido getting a meter or more of snow. 3-4 weeks ago was the dry period where it barely snowed in Central Hokkaido and the 20200114 temperature crust layer was unstable in places for some time, this layer was discussed and tested near Furano and to the NW. 


  Probably because I have not been to the big mountains recently, I have not heard about any accidents or serious signs of instability, aside from there obviously being a lot of loose fresh snow.. Although it snowed a little overnight, Yesterday was a fine day for a time in Central Hokkaido. 


  I﻿ know a lot of people that found very deep snow conditions over the last several days.


  My biggest concern is that the g﻿lide cracks are starting to open up and move a lot more. On Friday (20220217), the freezing level will rapidly rise several degrees and the temperature in the Furano Valley will likely reach 0 degrees Celsius. 


  This will be a dangerous time especially if it is a fine day because much of the cracked steeper terrain is likely at higher probability of collapsing catastrophically. So if it is ever a day significantly warmer than the previous day or the temperature is still increasing, limit time spent in the large gorges of the Furano Mountains. The destructive power of these types of avalanches is often earth damaging so be careful and stay away from the major terrain traps during these times. They can also just collapse anytime and run surprising distances.


  Going forward, I will be focusing on mostly just the storm snow, waiting for it to stabilize on the previous crust before attempting to go any ambitious places in the backcountry. Most of the creeks at lower elevations are well filled in although the lowest elevations are still thin in places due to December rain events.

    problem: Cornice Fall
    description: l﻿arge cornices have formed over the past 2 weeks. I have heard
      stories of skiers triggering large cornice falls that ran from alpine
      ridge lines all the way into low elevation creeks.
