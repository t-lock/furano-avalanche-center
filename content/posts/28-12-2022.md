  Dug a snowprofile today at 1213m on the way to the onsen. Stability is very
  good at this location. This was above the height of the 20221222-23 rain
  event. See [previous post](https://furanoavalanche.org/posts/25-12-2022/) for
  context.


  New storm cycle coming in now, will write about this soon.


  I am not worried about the old snow at all.
