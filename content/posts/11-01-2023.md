  雪崩心配している。


  日本語の記事がなくてすみません。\r

  私は今、スキーシーズン直前で準備がとても忙しいです。\r

  I﻿t has been a while since my last post. Apologies. Last post was generally
  correct with stability improving allowing me to ski big lines high in the
  alpine in very nice stable conditions aside from the standard loose snow
  avalanche risk.


  I﻿n the last post I also mentioned that I assumed stability would get worse,
  i.e. avalanche risk would increase with warming temperatures. I think this is
  correct especially in regards to tomorrow with the FL rising to 750m in Furano
  area.


  O﻿n the 7th, light fluffy snow fell with low windspeed. Yesterday/ last
  night (20230110 layer) the temperature increase leading to more cohesive snow.
  Today, while touring up to 1200m in the Yubari Mountains, I noticed slabby
  conditions on the E slopes and blowing snow.


  I﻿ think there are now slabs in the high alpine on E aspects with the less
  dense 20230107 later underneath, so it is not good that the density profile is
  upside down in the upper 2 layers of the snowpack. I am not concerned about
  layers below this.


  T﻿omorrow when it gets warm, there will be a dangerous avalanche cycle
  especially on the loaded steep SE aspects at all evelations. There is not so
  much loose snow in the low elevation band so not as bad for that reason.


  G﻿lide cracks will also be releasing as it gets warmer.


  T﻿omorrow, I will try to stay out of terrain traps and steep terrain, while
  staying above the FL to manage the risks.


  H﻿ave fun and be safe tomorrow while the avalanche risk is rapidly
  increasing.
