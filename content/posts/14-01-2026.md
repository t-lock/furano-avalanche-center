  Several 10s of cm of fresh snow has accumulated in the past few days.


  Moderate - heavy snowfall continues today with strong winds from the West. 


  E﻿ven in skier compacted areas such as Furano Ski Area side country, there is risk of loose snow avalanches. Be careful around ridgelines and creeks/ terrain traps tomorrow. Many large creek holes that are often filled in by now remain open. Tomorrow, around Furano ski area, there may be pockets of wind and storm slab to look out for.


  N﻿o doubt there is Considerable or possibly High risk of wind slab avalanche in the high alpine on E aspects by tomorrow morning due to the rapid rate of accumulation and strong W winds. 


  F﻿rom the 16th, there is no significant snowfall forecast for the Furano valley area for several days along with light winds and cold temperatures. Therefore, from the 16th, we expect avalanche risk to steadily decrease accompanied with fantastic backcountry skiing conditions if the current weather forecast holds.


  Please tell people who are venturing outside the backcountry gates with no safety gear that they are idiots... and enjoy the fresh snow safely!
